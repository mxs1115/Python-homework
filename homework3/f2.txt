With the falling away of the spring,summer,dressed in a green leaf in children bouncing around in the warm air came up.Summer,the blazing heat of summer means being strong,Summer Hill,such as Bi.Hot in the summer,but also beautiful.
I came to the field, summer months cicadas, the heat was not even close to dragonflies are only willing to shade at low-flying,as if afraid of the sun hurt their wings.
Tree branches, from time to time heard several"cicada cicada"sounds, it sounds crisp but pleasant, and occasionally make you feel tired, and sometimes, old people holding the fan while violently while saying, while listening to the sounds of cicadas singing, is really laid-back.
In the wide wilderness, through the blue sky, the sun hung like a fireball, the sun melted like clouds, and disappeared without a trace, the air is not a cloud, with no wind, head round the sun, all the trees hanging listlessly in the first.
Grass leaves, grass, reeds and red,white, purple flowers, are hanging in the sky of a hot steaming basking in the sun, the air filled with the sweet breath of drunk, really charming.
I like summer, like her beautiful scenery.
