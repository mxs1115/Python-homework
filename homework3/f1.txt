Summer is the second season in a year. It is between spring and autumn. The sun of summer is the hottest;the water of summer is the warmest; the places of interests in summer are the most crowded throughout the world.
Firstly, summer is students'the most favourite season because their longest vacations of the year are in summer.Many of them try to enrich their social and healthy life by participating in a number of interesting outdoor activities,include of camping with friends and family members, going to the beach or swimming at public pools,traveling and sightseeing locally and nationally. However,some of them try to make good use of their vacations in gaining their working experiences in summer.Other students may try to improve their academic performance by going to their summer schools.
Secondly,summer is a pleasant season for all kinds of cold foods and juicy fruits.Ice cream is our all time favourite dessert.Yeh,I love ice cream so much.I have to eat some ice cream almost everyday in summer.There are a lot of fresh fruits selling everywhere. Watermelon is proudly rated to be the most demanding fruit in the season. All kinds of iced drinks are greatly demanded in summer.
Thirdly, summer is a hot season for trendy fashion. You will see many sexy and curvy babes in your neighbourhood, on the beach,shopping malls, everywhere in your eyes.Hehe.All of my girlfriends and I like to wear as less as we wish in the summer.I like to wear shorts and t-shirts all the time.Don't forget to carrry your sunglasses and put on sun tan lotions before going outdoor.
